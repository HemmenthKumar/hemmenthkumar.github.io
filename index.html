                <h2 class="section-title">Why I Build.</p></h2>
                <p class="point">I never had a mentor as a kid, so I learned by breaking things. Phones, toys, electronics, none were spared; and I put them back together. Watched space and science documentaries my whole life to know how everything worked. That curiosity, from the cosmos to circuits, is now my compass.</p>
                <p class="point">Today, I build <span class="highlight">Idea Laboratory</span> so others don’t have to learn alone.</p>
                <div class="quote">
                    “This isn’t about degrees. It’s about turning raw curiosity into real things.”

                <h2 class="section-title">So Why Idea Laboratory?</h2>
                <p class="point">The Indian government has set up thousands of AICTE-IDEA Labs across the country. On paper, they’re meant to turn student ideas into real startups. But the reality is harsh: only <span class="highlight">217 startups were formally registered from over 12,000 ideas</span> (AICTE Annual Report, 2022–23).</p>
                <p class="point">Why? Because labs are handed over to <span class="highlight">overloaded faculty volunteering their time</span>. With no one to help with dedicated prototyping, equipment sits unused because no one knows how to operate it. Students are left to learn CAD, electronics, design, and everything else alone—usually meaning they must already be capable enough to create a startup, or they give up, even if their idea was viable.</p>
                <p class="point">They move on. <span class="highlight">Idea Laboratory exists to stop that leak.</span></p>

            <div class="section">
                <h2 class="section-title">What I Do.</p></h2>
                <p class="point">I help non-engineer <span class="highlight">innovators</span>; students, founders, dreamers, turn their ideas into <span class="highlight">functional</span>, investor ready <span class="highlight">prototypes</span> with <span class="highlight">full documentation</span></p>
                <p class="point">My process: fundamental understanding of the <span class="highlight">idea’s existence → technical spec → prototype build → pitch package</span>. I document every step so anyone can replicate it.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">My Path Forward.</p></h2>
                <p class="point"><span class="stage">Stage 1</span> Build portfolio via Riidl, internships, and freelance R&D consulting. Fund my rTMS treatment. Document everything.</p>
                <p class="point"><span class="stage">Stage 2</span> Partner with universities and incubators as a “portable prototyping lab” for student teams.</p>
                <p class="point"><span class="stage">Stage 3</span> Secure startup funding and launch a company. Scientists and researchers work in a lab, <span class="highlight">ideators work in an Idea Laboratory</span>.</p>

                <p><em>“I recognised how to use everything I had learned during my entire childhood. From the cosmos to humanity's inventions, with physics, chemistry, biology, math, engineering, and finally design, I interconnect concepts by multiplying them with each other, to figure out how to make almost anything. Applying one concept to another is easy when you have enough knowledge to understand both from the ground up, so you can correctly simulate every possibility of their interactions”</em></p>
